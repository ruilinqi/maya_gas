# maya_gas
This project "Gas Station" is a 3D model made using Maya, including human bodies, tanks, gas station scenes, etc. 
The girl and the tank each took about 3 hours to make, and then the scene was built and rendered. The rendering process includes the adjustment of lights, textures and cameras, and the adjustment of scenes and objects. 

The project was completed by myself. I have only studied modelling for one course, and this work is the most completed one at this stage. For me, its challenge lies in perseverance. Modeling itself is a labor-consuming task, but the sense of accomplishment it brings to me after rendering is unparalleled.

I upload the orginal model data file which is girl.mb.

The final model and scene data file is too large to upload. You may see pictures in folder images to see the final look.
